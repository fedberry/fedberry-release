<h2>Minimal &amp; XFCE Remixes</h2>
<p>Both these remixes are close to 'stock' arm releases from Fedora*. Where possible, they endeavor to stick to default Fedora release settings.</p>
<h2>Mini Remix</h2>
<p>This remix differs significantly from default Fedora settings used in their arm releases. It is a small 'bare bones' remix with some optimisations specifically tailored towards Rapsberry^ Pi 2 (RPi2) usage. Its main goals are to have a small footprint, fast boot times and to reduce the number of writes to the SD card (within reason).</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, sacrifices were made. For example, included language supoort is limited to en_US and security related features such as selinux or firewalld are disabled / removed. Therefore, it is not advisable to run services that are directly exposed to the internet, rather it should be safely tucked away behind a NAT firewall or something similar.</p>
<h4>Major changes include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate 'out of box' headless support, initial-setup is not run on first boot and passwords are set for both 'root' &amp; 'raspberry' users. Please see README for more information.</li>
<li>Root logins using sshd are disabled (login via ssh using 'raspberry' user instead).</li>
<li>There is limited 'out of box' hardware support. 'linux-firmware' is not installed by default on the image. You may need to install it for specific hardware support (eg. various wireless network cards). Please note, linux-firmware will be installed by default with a kernel update.</li>
<li>Language support is limited to en_US.utf8, all other languages have been stripped from the image to save space.</li>
<li>Documentation in rpm packages have been excluded from the image.</li>
<li>SELinux is disabled by default.</li>
<li>Firewalld is not installed.</li>
<li>Plymouth is not installed.</li>
<li>No swap partition is created or enabled by default.</li>
<li>The / (root) partition is NOT re-sized automatically on first boot.</li>
<li>Journaling on the ext4 / (root) partition is disabled and 'data=writeback' is enabled.</li>
<li>/tmp on tmpfs is enabled by default, but is size limited to 100M.</li>
<li>Journald logs size are limited to 20M.</li>
<li>Boot options (cmdline.txt) “elevator=deadline libahci.ignore_sss=1 raid=noautodetect” are now used by default.</li>
</ul>
