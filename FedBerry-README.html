<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>These are Fedora® Remix disk images specifically built for use with the Raspberry Pi® 2 (RPi2) computer. These disk images are unofficial Fedora Remixes and are not afiliated, provided or supported by the Fedora Project. Official, unmodified Fedora software is available through the Fedora Project website http://fedoraproject.org. *^</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Download images here: <a href="http://fedberry.agrez.net">http://fedberry.agrez.net</a></p>
<p>Please read <a href="https://github.com/fedberry/fedberry/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a></p>
<h2>First Boot</h2>
<h4>Minimal and XFCE release images</h4>
<p>The root partition is automatically re-sized when the OS is first booted. After re-sizing, it will automatically reboot. After rebooting the system will launch the 'initial-setup' utility. For graphical images this will occur on the display, for minimal images this will occur on the serial console. Failure to complete the initial-setup will prevent logging into the system.</p>
<h4>Mini release image</h4>
<p>The root partition is NOT automatically re-sized at boot due to boot time and image size considerations. The initial-setup utility is not used for this release.</p>
<h2>Default User / Passwords</h2>
<h4>Minimal and XFCE release images</h4>
<p>No root password or users are set by default. After the initial OS boot, please set the timezone, root password and create users when prompted at initial setup.</p>
<h4>Mini release image</h4>
<p>To facilitate default headless support, a root user password is already set. Please remember to change the root password after the first boot.</p>
<p><strong>Root password = fedberry</strong></p>
<p>A default user of 'raspberry' is also created but password change is required after the first login.</p>
<p><strong>User password = raspberry</strong></p>
<h2>Additional or Modified Software</h2>
<p>Our Yum repository is located here: <a href="https://vaughan.fedorapeople.org">https://vaughan.fedorapeople.org</a></p>
<p>As this is a Fedora Remix, some additional or modified RPMs are included to enable full compatibility with the BCM2836 SOC (RPi2) or to add extra features. The most significant change is a custom kernel. The included kernel has vanilla kernel.org sources patched with modications from the Raspberry Pi foundation's kernel tree (bcm2709 port). Refer here: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.</p>
<p>All software sources for the RPMs can be found in our githib repositories (https://github.com/fedberry) or the provided SRPMs here: https://vaughan.fedorapeople.org/fed23/SRPMS</p>
